        <h3>No better comfort food than chicken pot pie!</h3>
        <p>Chicken pot pie has always been a comfort food of mine since I 
            was a little girl. Chicken pot pie was a staple in the DiAgostino
            household. My mother made it at least every other week in the winter.
            When I got older enough to start cooking independently, the dish
            I can remember making was chicken pot pie.</p>
            <p> I am now 28, and have lived in many different places, but no matter 
                where I have gone this recipe always followed with me. I made this 
                for my roomates in college. I made it for my roommates when we studied 
                abroad in Florence, Italy. It was the first dinner I made for my boyfriend.
                This recipe is more than just a meal, its apart of my life.</p>
