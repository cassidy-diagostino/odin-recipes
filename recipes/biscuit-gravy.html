    <p class="intro">Growing up my dad always made breakfast for us every Sunday morning.
        Usually it was his famous chocolate chip pancakes but occasionally
        he would make us biscuit and gravy. This recipe is such a hearty and 
        delicious breakfast. It is such a comforting dish that will make everyone 
        in your house leave the breakfast table with a full belly and a smile on 
        their face!</p>

            <li>1 can of refrigerates jumbo buttermilk biscuits</li>
            <li>1 package of pork sausage (found in the breakfast freezer section)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Arrange biscuits 
                1 to 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. 
                Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 
                13 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until thoroughly 
                heated, stirring frequently, about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour until well combined. Gradually add milk, stirring continuously, 
                until the gravy thickens and comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 
                and stir for 2 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Split biscuits in half. Place 2 halves on each of 8 plates; top with about 1/3 cup gravy.</li>
        </ol>
