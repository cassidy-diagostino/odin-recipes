        <h2><span>Mouth watering chicken tortellini soup!</span></h2>
        <p class="intro">This crockpot chicken tortellini soup is lusciously cream-free, 
            comforting, and made with lots of vegetables. Perfect with crusty bread
            and a green salad.</p>
        <p class="intro">This soup is perfect for the cold winter months. It is such an easy recipe to prep
            making it perfect for a working parent. While this recipe was originally made for the 
            crockpot you can make it just as easily on the stove in a fraction of the time. If you're like me 
            and do not have the patience to wait for the crockpot, you can just use a rotisserie chicken.
            I promise you either way you decide to make this recipe the flavor and comfort is all there!</p>
